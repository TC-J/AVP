# Audio- Video- Processing in Python

## Summary
We're creating primitives that make audio and video processing easier and educational at the low-level; and then we
are finding high level semantics for the processing done on these primitives; and finally making it easier somehow to
do AI and feature extraction, filtering, and any highlevel tasks we can think of, but not a priority.
